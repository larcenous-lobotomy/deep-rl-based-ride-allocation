# Goal

To construct a ride-recommender system based on deep reinforcement learning, to provide cab drivers with recommendations for ride acceptance.

# Introduction

The cab-driver may be treated as a reward-seeking agent in an environment of customers. The system aims to assist the cab driver in picking
the right ride requests out of a queue (or not picking any), in a way that optimises his long-term income throughout the day. For this purpose, the
ride-recommender system will utilise a deep reinforcement learning approach. 

Specifically, our system will use a deep q-learning strategy. For algorithmic reference, we use **Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction** by Andrew Barto and Richard S Sutton.
